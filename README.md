# Retail-Sales-Customer-Behaviour
This project focuses on end-to-end Customer Sales Analytics, covering data engineering, advanced SQL analysis, Python-based RFM segmentation, and dashboard visualization. A robust Star Schema (Fact Sales, Customer and Product dimensions) was designed with cleaned transaction data and optimized SQL views. Using Python, RFM scores were calculated to segment customers into categories such as Champions, Loyalists, and Hibernating, along with association rule mining for product bundle insights. The processed data was integrated into Power BI to build interactive dashboards with cohort analysis and row-level security, and the entire workflow was automated using a production-ready ETL pipeline.
